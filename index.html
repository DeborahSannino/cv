                <h3>Translation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ </h3>
                <p><q>Translation is that which transforms everything so that nothing changes. – Günter Grass</q></p>
                <p>I am highly skilled at organizing, planning, and making documents easy-to-read for Italian readers.
                I have a passion for language and how it reads across cultures. My goal is to make sure the experience provided
                by a product is replicated to the Italian audience through a lot of research, storytelling techniques, and
                understanding of the target market.</p>

                <h3>Localization ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h3>
                <p><q>Be conscious of the global elements in your dreams. When starting local, dream of taking it global sooner.”
                ― Israelmore Ayivor, Shaping the dream</q></p>
                <p>Localization is often confused with translation, but these terms actually mean two different things. Translation refers to the conversion of written text from one language to another, while localization is the process of
                making a product or message resonate with a specific target culture—as if it were created there in the first place. In this process time zones, money, national holidays, local color sensitivities, product or service name translation, gender roles and geographic references must all be considered.</p>

            <h3>Proofreading ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h3>
            <p>Proofreading means carefully checking for errors in a text before it is published or shared. It is the very last stage
            of the writing process, when you fix minor spelling and punctuation mistakes, typos, formatting issues and
            inconsistencies. I pay careful attention to detail, correcting grammar, spelling, punctuation, syntax, and repetition. All my work is
            done PERSONALLY and PROFESSIONALLY.

    <h3>Web Developing ⭐⭐⭐</h3>
    <p> I still a junior front-end developer, but I'm always up to learn new things and I always try to improve myself and get
    more and more experience. I have experience using these skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Jquery to make you a stunning responsive
    website.
